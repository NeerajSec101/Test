==========================
what is .gitignore file? What type of data it contain? Can we make some logic in this file?

===========================================================================
>>.gitignore only contain ignorable data that can not be in Local repository(LR). LR is contain only source code. We can only give some intructions inside to ignore the files like:
(*.class,*.txt,*.png etc). We can not make some logic in this. gitignore only understand * and file names with extention.

What is Git Stash?
============================
Git stash is basically hidding the unfinshed source code.
